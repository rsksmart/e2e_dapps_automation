# E2E Browser Automation for web3 dApps
Run native automation for web3 dApps using Cucumber-Playwright-Synpress in Javascript.
In the current version of Synpress, only MetaMask wallet is supported.
Support for other wallets is being added at [Synpress New Dawn](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synpress/tree/new-dawn).

## Configuration

- Clone the project

- Install dependencies `npm i` in the terminal or run the `npm:install` script

- Create a `.env` file inside `config` folder containing your MetaMask wallet address information (seed & password) as follows. Example:

```
secretWordsOrPrivateKey=test test test test test test test test test test test test
password=Tester@1234
```

* Please note that this is sensitive information, even if it is stored locally in the `.env` file. If shared anyhow you could potentially loose all your funds. Ensure the provided wallet is for testing purposes only.

- Metamask version can be provided either in the `.env` file or in the `src/hooks/fixtures.js` file as follows:

```    
const metamaskPath = await prepareMetamask(
    process.env.METAMASK_VERSION || "10.25.0"
);
```

- In order to be able to test your own dApp on your preferred blockchain, go to `config/config.js` and modify the following parameters:

```
// dApp under test
const dAppURL = 'https://wallet.testnet.rollup.rif.technology/';

// Custom network under test
const networkConfiguration = {
  networkName: 'Rootstock',
  rpcUrl: 'https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co',
  chainId: '31',
  symbol: 'RBTC',
  isTestnet: true
}
```

## Running tests & Reports

Since this is a boilerplate project, just a 'demo.feature' has been implemented.
Feel free to build your test suite at `src/test/features/_dappLivingDocumentation/`

- Execute `test` or `npm test` script to run the tests using chromium

- Generated reports will be located at `reports` folder

## XRay integration
### Downloading/Uploading Cucumber features & Creating Test Executions in Jira

- In order to submit the local test execution to Jira, execute `cucumber:submit_results` script. Remember to configure the `config/xray/cucumber.config.json` accordingly and have set the Jira XRay credentials in your environment variables.

Please refer to the repository [@xray-app/xray-automation module](https://github.com/rsksmart/xray-automation) to learn more about XRay Jira integration.
